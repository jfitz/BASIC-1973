WE CAN ALSO USE A LOOP.  THE LONGER THE LIST THE BETTER
BEING ABLE TO USE A LOOP IS

WE CAN PRINT THE LIST BACKWARDS WITH FOR X=4 TO 1 STEP -1
 8 -92  9  4 

WE CAN RELOCATE ITEMS IN THE LIST
250 LET Z=L[1], 260 LET L[1]=L[2] AND 270 LET L[2]=Z
GIVE THE FOLLOWING RESULT
L[1] = 9
L[2] = 4
LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE ORIGINAL LIST
WE HAVE EXCHANGED ITEMS ONE AND TWO

WE CAN PUSH EVERY NUMBER UP FOUR LOCATIONS IN THE LIST
