ACEYDU 



ACEY DUCEY CARD GAME 



Description 



This is a simulation of the Acey Ducey card game. In the 
game, the dealer (the computer) deals two cards face up. 
You have an option to bet or not to bet depending on whether 
or not you feel the next card dealt will have a value between 
the first two. 

Your initial money (Q) is set to $100; you may alter Statement 
170 if you want to start with more or less than $100. The 
game keeps going on until you lose all your money or interrupt 
the program.

AMAZIN 



DRAW A MAZE 



Description 



This program will print out a different maze every time it 
is run and guarantees only one path through. You can choose 
the dimensions of the maze — -i.e. the number of squares wide 
and long. 

Computer Limitations 

The amount of memory available will determine the maximum 
size maze that may be constructed. An 8K EduSystem 20 
initialized for one user can draw a 13x13 maze. RSTS/E 
can draw a 23 (width of paper limit) x 50 maze, even larger 
using virtual memory. 

Experiment on your system with the maze dimensions in 
Statement 110.

ANIMAL 



COMPUTER GUESSES YOUR ANIMAL 



Description 



Unlike other computer games in which the computer picks a 
number or letter and you must guess what it is, in this 
game you think of an animal and the computer asks you 
questions and tries to guess the name of your animal. If 
the computer, guesses incorrectly, it will ask you for a 
question that differentiates the animal it guessed from the 
one you were thinking of. In this way the computer "learns" 
new animals. Questions to differentiate new animals should 
be input without a question mark. 

IMPORTANT: At the end of a playing session, to the question, 
"ARE YOU THINKING OF AN ANIMAL," you must respond "SAVE" 
in order that the computer save all the new animals you have 
introduced. To that same question, at any point in the game, 
if you respond "LIST," the computer will tell you all the 
animals it knows so far. 

The program starts originally by knowing only "FISH" and 
"BIRD." Additional animals are stored in the file "ANIMAL. GME. " 

Computer Limitations 

This program was written for a DIGITAL RSTS-11 and uses several 
unique features, in particular, multiple user access to a 
common data file and several advanced string handling functions. 
It has been converted with some minor changes to OS/8 BASIC 
and could be adapted to other systems as well.

Your 
HOME 



Your SIDE 

AWARI game is played with seven sticks and thirty-six stones 
(beans) laid out as shown above. The board is divided into six 
compartments (PITS) on 'my SIDE 1 and six on 'your SIDE' . In 
addition, there are two special PITS at the ends: 'my HOME 1 
and 'your HOME' . 

A MOVE is made by taking all of the beans from any (non-empty) 
PIT on your own SIDE. Starting from the PIT to the right of 
this one, these beans are 'SOWN' one in each PIT working around 
the board anticlockwise. 

A TURN consists of one or two MOVEs. If the last bean of your 
MOVE is SOWN in your own HOME you may take a second MOVE. 

If the last bean SOWN in a MOVE lands in an empty PIT, provided 
that the opposite PIT is not empty/ all the beans in the opposite 
PIT, together with the last bean SOWN are "' captured ' and moved 
to the player's HOME. 



When either side is empty, the game is finished, 
with most beans in his HOME has won. 



The player 



19 



In the computer version, the board is printed as 14 numbers 
representing the 14 PITS* 

3 3 3 3 3 3 



3 3 3 3 33 

The PITS on your (lower) SIDE are numbered 1-6 from left to 
right. The PITS on my (the computer's) SIDE are numbered from 
my left (your right). 

To make a MOVE you type in the number of a PIT. If the last bean 
lands in your HOME, the computer types 'AGAIN? 1 and you then type 
in your second move. 

The computer's MOVE is typed, followed by a diagram of the board 
in its new state. The computer always offers you the first move. 
This is considered to be a slight advantage. 

There is a learning mechanism in the program that causes the 
play of the computer to improve as it plays more games. 

Computer Limitations 

This program is written in DIGITAL PDP-11 BASIC. The only 
unusual feature is that an IF statement may have the form: 

IF (CONDITION) THEN (STATEMENT) 

Whenever the IF condition fails, the program branches to the 
next line.

Stolz of Lexington High School. The version published (also 
known as BEANS) along with the description above was written by:

NUMBER LOGIC GAME 



Description 



The computer picks a 3-digit secret number and you attempt 
to guess what it is. You are allowed up to twenty guesses. 
No digit is repeated. After each guess the computer will 
give you clues about your guess as follows: 

PICO One digit is correct, but in the wrong place 
FERMI One digit is in the correct place 
BAGLES No digit is correct 

You will learn to draw inferences from the clues and, with 
practice, you'll learn to improve your score. There are 
several good strategies for playing BAGLES. After you have 
found a good strategy, see if you can improve it. Or try 
a different strategy altogether and see if it is any better. 

This program was submitted from several sources including 
Dartmouth and U.C. -Berkeley. The one published here is 
from U.C.

BANNER 



PRINTS A LARGE BANNER 



Description 



This program creates a large banner on a terminal of any 
message you input (up to 54 characters in length) • The 
letters may be any dimension you wish although the letter 
height plus distance from left-hand side should not exceed 
6 inches. Also, the letter height should be somewhat more 
than the width. Adhering to these rules will generally produce 
a very attractive banner. 

Computer Limitations 

BANNER was written for a DIGITAL EduSystem 50. For other 
computers, the character string line input (LINPUT) statement 
at Line 240 would have to be changed.

BASEBALL GAME 



Description 



This is a simulation of a nine-inning baseball game with you 
controlling the pitcher when your team has the field and 
controlling the batter when you are up to bat. The simulation 
stops at nine innings, hence, it may be a tie game; however, 
that has proved to occur remarkably few times. 

Computer Limitations 

The game published was written for DIGITAL EduSystem 15/30/35 
and actually consists of two programs, one which prints the 
rules chained to the second program which plays the game. 
"NOLINE" must be given before running to prevent overflow. 
Other BASIC compilers will require conversion of the alphabetic 
string input statements to a compatible format. 

Source 

Another version of baseball was submitted for Timeshared-8 
by Jeff Moskow and Brad Golden of Lexington High School. 
This is available from DECUS as BASIC 8-562. A second version 
was submitted by another Lexington High School student, Les 
Servie. A FORTRAN version was submitted by David Benepe of 
Fort Worth, Texas. These versions are not printed herein.

BASKETBALL GAME VS DARTMOUTH 



Description 



This program simulates a game of basketball between Dartmouth 
College and an opponent of your choice. You are the Dartmouth 
captain and control the type of shot and defense during the 
course of the game. 

There are four types of shots: 1. Long Jump Shot (30 ft.), 
2. Short Jump Shot (15 ft.), 3. Lay Up, and 4. Set Shot. 
Both teams use the same defense, but you may call it: Press (6), 
Man-to-man (6.5), Zone (7), or None (7.5). To change defense, 
type "0" as your next shot. 

Note: The game is biased slightly in favor of Dartmouth. The 
average probability of a Dartmouth shot being good is 62.95% 
compared to a probability of 61.85% for their opponent. 
(This makes the sample run somewhat remarkable in that Cornell 
won by a score of 51 to 35. Hooray for the Big Redl)

BATNUM 



BATTLE OF NUMBERS 



Description 



The game starts with an imaginary pile of objects, coins for 
example. You and your opponent (the computer) alternately 
remove objects from the pile. You specify in advance the 
minimum and maximum number of objects that can be taken on 
each turn. You also specify in advance how winning is 
defined: 1. To take the last object or 2. To avoid taking 
the last object. You may also determine whether you or the 
computer go first. 

The strategy of this game is based on modulo arithmetic. If 
the maximum number of objects a player may remove in a turn 
is M, then to gain a winning position a player at the end of 
his turn must leave a stack of 1 modulo (M+l) coins. If you 
don't understand this, play 23 Matches (23 MTCH) first, then 
BATNUM, and just have funi 

Program Author 

BATNUM is based on an old game similar to NIM. Its adaptation 
for the computer appears to originally be by the daddy of 
BASIC:

THIS PROGRAM IS A 'BATTLE OF NUMBERS' 
GAME, WHERE THE COMPUTER IS YOUR OPPONENT. 

THE GAME STARTS WITH AN ASSUMED PILE OF OBJECTS. YOU AND 

VOUR OPPONENT ALTERNATLY REMOVE OBJECTS FROM THE PILE. 

WINNING IS DEFINED IN ADVANCE AS TAKING THE LAST OBJECT 

OR NOT. YOU CAN ALSO SPECIFY SOME OTHER BEGINNING 

CONDITIONS. DON'T USE ZERO, HOWEVER, IN PLAYING THE GAME.

BATTLE 



NAVAL SHIP BATTLE 

Description 

This description is an adaptation of the one written by Ray 
Westergard, the program author. 

"BATTLE is based on the popular game Battleship which is 
primarily played to familiarize people with the location 
and designation of points on a coordinate plane." 

BATTLE first randomly sets up the bad guys' fleet disposition 
on a 6 by 6 matrix or grid. The fleet consists of six ships: 
Two destroyers (ships number 1 and 2) which are two units long, 
two cruisers (ships number 3 and 4) which are three units long 
and two aircraft carriers (ships number 5 and 6) which are 
four units long. The program then prints out this fleet dis- 
position in a coded or disguised format (see the sample com- 
puter print-out) . You then proceed to sink the various ships 
by typing in the coordinates (two digits, each from 1 to 6, 
separated by a comma) of the place where you want to drop a 
bomb, if you'll excuse the expression. The computer gives 
the appropriate responses (splash, hit, etc.) which you should 
record on a 6 by 6 matrix. You are thus building a representa- 
tion of the actual fleet disposition which you will hopefully 
use to decode the coded fleet disposition printed out by the 
computer. Each time a ship is sunk, the computer prints out 
which ships have been sunk so far and also gives you a 
"SPLASH/HIT RATIO". 

The first thing you should learn is how to locate and designate 
positions on the matrix, and specifically the difference between 
"3,4" and "4,3". Our method corresponds to the location of 
points on the coordinate plane rather than the location of 
numbers in a standard algebraic matrix: The first number gives 
the column counting from left to 'right and the second number 
gives the row counting from bottom to top. 

The second thing you should learn about is the splash/hit ratio. 
"What is a ratio?" A good reply is "It's a fraction or quotient." 
Specifically, the splash/hit ratio is the number of splashes 
divided by the number of hits. If you had 9 splashes and 15 
hits, the ratio would be 9/15 or 3/5, both of which are correct. 
The computer would give this splash/hit ratio as .6. 

One of the main objects and primary educational benefits of 
BATTLE comes from attempting to decode the bad guys' fleet 
disposition code. To do this, you must make a COMPARISON 
between the coded matrix and the actual matrix which you con- 
struct as you play the game.

BINGO 



COMPUTER BINGO 



Description 



In this game you and the computer play a game of bingo. The 
computer first generates a bingo card for both you and itself, 
It then spins the number drum and draws numbers at random 
which it posts on "the board." It's up to you to play both 
your card and the card of the computer (a second person can 
play this card if you wish) . 

The computer checks for BINGO on both cards, so don't try to 
cheat 1 

Source 

Sorry folks — the author and source are totally unknown. 
It showed up on an in-plant DIGITAL DECsystem-10 quite 
mysteriously one day last year.

GAME OF BLACKJACK 



Description 



This is a simulation of the game of blackjack or 21, Las Vegas 
style. This is one of the more comprehensive versions of black- 
jack which allows splitting your hand if the first two cards 
are the same. Also/ the dealer will ask for an insurance bet 
if he has an exposed ace. The house limit is $500.00. 

Source 

A number of versions of this program were submitted. Ira Gold- 
stein of Fort Worth, Texas, submitted a particularly interesting 
version which uses a second chained program (DECK) to shuffle 
the cards. Two versions are printed here — one written and 
modified by a number of DIGITAL personnel for RSTS-11 and 
another written by students at the Oregon Museum of Science 
and Industry and slightly modified at DIGITAL.

BOAT 



SUBMARINE VS GUNBOAT 



Description 



You are captain of a submarine and the computer is captain of 
a gunboat. The speed of the gunboat is given at the beginning 
of the game. You fire torpedos at the gunboat. To sink it, 
you must hit it twice in at least two vulnerable places, or 
once in a vulnerable place and twice in any other part of the 
hull. But, if you ever miss, the gunboat will open fire on 
you. If this happens, you alternatively fire at each other 
until you sink the gunboat or until he sinks you. 

Source 

To the best of our knowledge, we think BOAT was originally 
written by a student at the University of Georgia, Athens, GA.

BOMBER 



FLY A WORLD WAR II BOMBER 



Description 



In this program, you fly a World War II bomber for one of the 
four protagonists of the war. You then pick your target or the 
type of plane you are flying. Depending upon your flying ex- 
perience and the quality of the enemy defenders , you then may 
accomplish your mission, get shot down, or make it back through 
enemy fire. In any case, you get a chance to fly again.

BOUNCE 



PLOT OF BOUNCING BALL 



Description 

This program plots a bouncing ball. Most computer plots run 
along the paper in the terminal (top to bottom) ; however , this 
plot is drawn horizontally on the paper (left to right) . 

You may specify the initial velocity of the ball and the 
coefficient of elasticity of the ball (a superball is about 
0.85 — other balls are much less). You also specify the 
time increment to be used in "strobing" the flight of the 
ball. In other words, it is as though the ball is thrown 
up in a darkened room and you flash a light at fixed time 
intervals and photograph the progress of the ball.

BOWLING GAME 



Description 



This is a simulated bowling game for up to four players. 
You play 10 frames. To roll the ball, you simply type 
"ROLL". After each roll, the computer will show you a 
diagram of the remaining pins ("0" means the pin is down, 
" + " means it is still standing), and it will give you a 
roll analysis: 

GUTTER 

STRIKE 

SPARE 

ERROR (on second ball if pins still standing) 

Another considerably simpler bowling game was submitted by 
Bion Rogers and Mark Gustitus of Springfield, PA; it is 
not published.

OLYMPIC BOXING MATCH 



Description 



This program simulates a three-round Olympic boxing match. 
The computer coaches one of the boxers and determines his 
punches and defenses, while you do the same for your boxer. 
At the start of the match, you may specify your man's best 
punch and his vulnerability. 

There are approximately seven major punches per round, although 
this may be varied in Statement 185. The best two out of 
three rounds wins.

BUG 



Description 



DRAW A BUG VS THE COMPUTER 



The object of this game is to finish your drawing of a bug 
before the computer finishes his. You and the computer roll 
a die alternately with each number standing for a part of 
the bug. You must add the parts in the right order; in other 
words, you cannot have a neck until you have a body, you 
cannot have a head until you have a neck, and so on. After 
each new part has been added, you have the option of seeing 
pictures of the two bugs. 

If you elect to see all the pictures, this program has the 
ability of consuming well over six feet of Teletype paper 
per run. We can only suggest recycling the paper by using 
the other side.

BULCOW 



BULLS AND COWS GUESSING GAME 



Description 



In this game, a somewhat advanced version of BAGLES, the idea 
is that each player (you and the computer) tries to guess a 
5-digit number thought up by the opposing player. A BULL is 
scored for each correct digit in the correct position and a 
COW for each correct digit but out of position. For example: 



Mystery number 
Your guess 



51340 

21734 scores 1 BULL and 2 COWS 



In the first sample run, the human player's mystery number was 
12345. In the second run, the number was 13579. Notice that 
on the fourth computer guess , 35719, the human player told the 
computer 0,5 (i.e., no BULLS and 5 COWS) . This was incorrect; 
it should have been 1,4 , but the computer could not know that 
until two turns later when it realized that the human had given 
it impossible scores. 

By about the fourth or fifth guess, the computer starts taking 
quite a bit of time to narrow its choices between guesses. 
Be patient.

THROW DARTS 



Description 



In this game, up to 20 players throw darts at a target with 
10- , 20-/ 30-, and 40-point zones. The objective is to get 
200 points. 

You have a choice of three methods of throwing: 

Throw Description Probable Score 



1 
2 
3 



Fast overarm 
Controlled overarm 
Underarm 



Bullseye or complete miss 
10 , 20, or 30 points 
Anything 



You will find after playing a while that different players 
will swear by different strategies. However, consider the 
expected score per throw by always using Throw 3 (program 
line 220) : 



Score 


(S) 


Probability (P) 


S x P

1.00-.95 = .05 
.95-. 75 = .20 
.75-. 45 = .30 
.45-. 05 = .40 
.05-. 00 = .05

BULL 



BULLFIGHT 



Description 



In this simulated bullfight, you are the matador— -i.e.,. the 
one with the principal role and the one who must kill the 
bull or be killed (or run from the ring) . 

On each pass of the bull, you may try: 

Veronica (dangerous inside move of the cape) 

1 Less dangerous outside move of the cape 

2 Ordinary swirl of the cape 
Or you may try to kill the bull: 

4 Over the horns 

5 In the chest 

The crowd will determine what award you deserve, posthumously 
if necessary. The braver you are, the better the award you 
receive. It's nice to stay alive too. The better the job 
the picadores and toreadores do, the better your chances. 

This program was converted to standard BASIC (DIGITAL 
Timeshared-8) by students at Lexington High School under 
the direction of Walt Koetke.

BUZZWORD GENERATOR 



Description 



This program is an invaluable aid for preparing speeches and 
briefings about computers and high technology. This buzzword 
generator provides sets of three highly-acceptable words to 
work into your material. Your audience will never know that 
the phrases don't really mean much of anything because they 
sound so great! Full instructions for running are given in 
the program.

PERPETUAL CALENDAR 



Description 

This program prints out a calendar for any year. You must 
specify the starting day of the week of the year in Statement 
130. (Sunday (0), Monday (-1), Tuesday (-2), etc.). You can 
determine this by using the program WEKDAY. You must also 
make two changes for leap years in Statements 360 and 620. 
The program listing describes the necessary changes. Running 
the program produces a nice 12-month calendar.

CAN-AM 



CANADIAN-AMERICAN AUTO RACE 



Description 



CAN-AM is a simulation of a Canadian -American Challenge Cup auto 
race. The road course is fast (speeds up to 200 m.p.h.). It is 
long (5.3 miles) and complex (8 curves and 8 straights). You are 
racing the latest Group 7 cars (McLarens, Lolas, etc.). 

The instructions provided by the program are self -explanatory. 
You should really take heed of track hazards — i.e., rain and oil, 
except, of course, slowing down too much puts you out of con- 
tention. BEWARE: This game is very challenging and addictive I 

Computer Limitations 

The program was written for the Honeywell/GE 635 at Dartmouth. 
The main inconsistency with other computers is that several 
people may race using multiple terminals; this is generally 
not possible on smaller machines. 

The comments on the listing are extremely comprehensive and 
entertaining. We apologize for not having a sample run, but 
it got wiped out.

COMPUTER IMITATES CASHIER 



Description 

In this program, the computer pretends it is the cashier at 
your friendly neighborhood candy store. You tell it the cost 
of the item(s) you are buying, the amount of your payment, and 
it will automatically (I) determine your correct change. Aren't 
machines wonderful?

Home (1,1) is in the bottom left and X specifies distance to 
the right of home (i.e., column) and Y specifies distance 
above home (i.e., row) . You then specify where you wish to 
move to . 

Limitations 

Unfortunately, the computer program is not smart enough to 
recognize (or permitl) a double or triple jump. If you try 
one, it is likely that your piece will disappear altogether.

CHEMST 



DILUTE KRYPTOCYANIC ACID 



Description 

The fictitious chemical, kryptocyanic acid, can only be diluted 
by the ratio of 7 parts water to 3 parts acid. Any other ratio 
causes an unstable compound which soon explodes. Given an 
amount of acid, you must determine how much water to add for 
dilution. If you're more than 5% off, you lose one of your 
nine lives. The program continues to play until you lose all 
nine lives or until it is interrupted.

CHIEF 



ARITHMETIC PRACTICE 



Description 

In the words of the program author, John Graham, 

"CHIEF is designed to give people (mostly kids) practice in the 
four operations (addition, multiplication, subtraction, and 
division) . 

It does this while giving people some fun. And then, if the 
people are wrong, it shows them how they should have done it. 

It is mostly a game, but can be used by teachers to test the 
kids."

CHOMP 



EAT A BIG COOKIE 



Description 



This program is an adaptation of a mathematical game originally 
presented in Scientific American, Jan., 1973. Up to a 9x9 grid 
is set up by you with the upper left square a poison square. 
This grid is the cookie. Players alternately chomp away at the 
cookie from the lower right. To take a chomp, input a row and 
column number of one of the squares remaining on the cookie. 
All of the squares below and to the right of that square, in- 
cluding that square, disappear. 

Any number of people can play — • the computer is only the 
moderator; it is not a player. Two-person strategies are in- 
teresting to work out but strategies when three or more people 
are playing are a real challenge.

CIVIL WAR GAME 



Description 



This simulation is based on 14 battles in the Civil War. Facts 
and figures used are based on the actual occurrence. If you 
follow the same strategy used in the actual battle, the results 
will be the same — generally, this is a good strategy since the 
generals in the Civil War were fairly good military strategists- 
However, you can frequently outperform the Civil War generals, 
particularly in cases where they did not have good enemy in- 
telligence and consequently followed a poor course of action. 
Naturally, it helps to know your Civil War history, although 
the computer gives you the rudiments. 

After each of the 14 battles, your casualties are compared to 
the actual casualties of the battle, and you are told whether 
you win or lose the battle. 

Program Author 

CIVIL WAR was written in 1968 by three students:

CRAPS 



GAME OF CRAPS (DICE) 



Description 



One of the more popular computer games , six versions of CRAPS 
were submitted (although three appear to be virtually the same 
program). The version published here is based on standard 
Nevada craps table rules. That is: 

1. A 7 or 11 on the first roll wins 

2. A 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll loses 

3. Any other number rolled becomes your "point." You 
continue to roll; if you get your point , you win. 
If you roll a 7, you lose and the dice change hands 
when this happens. 

Your stake is set in Statement 210; this could be changed to 
an input statement if desired. 

Source 

An interesting version of CRAPS was submitted by Philip Bieluch 
of Trinity College which uses a file to keep track of prior 
winnings and/or losses. A short but complete version was sub- 
mitted by George Gidzinski of Adlai Stevenson High School , 
Prairie View/ Illinois. 

The published version has been circulating around DIGITAL and 
its users for years. The original author is unknown.

CUBE 



TRAVEL ACROSS A 3-D CUBE 



Description 



CUBE is a game played on cube with a side dimension of 2. a 
location is designated by three numbers — e.g., 1, 2, 1. The 
object is to travel from 1, 1, 1 to 3, 3, 3 by moving one 
horizontal or vertical (not diagonal) square at a time without 
striking one of 5 randomly placed landmines. You are staked 
to $500; prior to each play of the game you may make a wager 
whether you will reach your destination. You lose if you hit 
a mine or try to make an illegal move — i.e., change more than 
one digit from your previous position.

Description 



This program fills an 8%xll piece of paper with diamonds (plotted 
on a hard-copy terminal, of course) . The program asks for an 
odd number to be input in the range 5 to 31. The diamonds printed 
will be this number of characters high and wide. The number of 
diamonds across the page will vary from 12 for 5-character wide 
diamonds to 1 for a diamond 3 1-characters wide.

DIGITS 



COMPUTER TRIES TO OUTGUESS PLAYER 



Description 



The player writes down a set of 30 numbers (0, 1, or 2) at random 
prior to playing the game. The computer program, using pattern 
recognition techniques, attempts to guess the next number in 
the input. 

The computer asks for 10 numbers at a time. It always guesses 
first and then examines the next number to see if it guessed 
correctly. By pure luck (or chance or probability), the com- 
puter ought to be right 10 times. It is uncanny how much better 
it generally does than that!

DOGS 



__ _ DOG RACE 

Description 

This is a dog race game similar to those found in penny arcades 
and amusement parks. The prior racing experience of each dog 
(wins and losses) has a bearing on the outcome of the race. 
After this is posted, up to 19 players may bet on a dog. 
Maximum bet is $500.00 and minimum is $2.00. 

After all the bets are in, the odds will be posted and the race 
begins! After each days ' s racing, the track will close and 
record the performance of all the dogs in a permanent file 
which is called the next time the program is run. 

Computer Limitations 

DOGS was written for a DIGITAL EduSystem 50 (Timeshared-8) ; 
consequently, the file handling routine (Lines 25, 30, 35, 55, 
975, 985, 1085) may have to be changed for other systems. 

Program Author 

The author remarks that he is now 15 and started using a PDP-8 
at the age of 12. Since then he has compiled 4 notebooks of 
programs in BASIC, FOCAL, FORTRAN, and ALGOL. Of his 23 BASIC 
games, 5 are published in this book.

PICK UP AN EVEN NUMBER OF OBJECTS 



Description 



This is a game between you and the computer. To play, an odd 
number of objects (marbles, chips, matches) are placed in a row. 
You take turns with the computer picking up between one and four 
objects each turn. The game ends when there are no objects left, 
and the winner is the one with an even number of objects picked 
up. 

Two versions of this game are printed herein. While to the player 
they appear similar, the programming approach is quite different. 
EVEN, the first version, is deterministic — i.e., the computer 
plays by fixed, good rules and is impossible to beat if you don't 
know how to play the game. 

The second version, EVEN 1, is much more interesting because the 
computer starts out only knowing the rules of the game. Using 
simple techniques of artificial intelligence (cybernetics) , the 
computer gradually learns to play from its mistakes until it 
plays a very good game. After 20 games, the computer is a 
challenge to beat. Variation in the human's style of play seems 
to make the computer learn more quickly. If you plot the learn- 
ing curve of this program, it closely resembles classical human 
learning curves from psychological experiments.

reverse some other position tool You ought to be able to 
change all 10 in 12 or fewer moves. Can you figure out a good 
winning strategy? 

To reset the line to all X' s (same game), type (zero) . To 
start a new game at any point, type 11.

GAME OF FOOTBALL 



Description 



Football is probably the most popular simulated sports game. 
Some people have elected to play computerized football in 
preference to watching a bowl game on television. 

The simulation uses standard professional football rules ex- 
cept there are no penalties. The computer takes the part of 
your opposing team and also the referee. Eight plays can be 
run on offense and five on defense. The program presents 
necessary rules as you play. 

Source 

Two versions of football are presented herein, A third version 
received from Paul Garmon of Wellesley Jr. High School is not 
printed.

FURS 



FUR TRADING EXPEDITION 



Description 



You are the leader of a French fur trading expedition in 1776 
leaving the Ontario area to sell furs and get supplies for the 
next year. You have a choice of three forts at which you may 
trade. The cost of supplies and the amount you receive for your 
furs will depend upon the fort you choose. You also specify 
what types of furs that you have to trade. 

The game goes on and on until you elect to trade no longer.

GOLF 



18 HOLES OF GOLF 



Description 



Up to four players may play up to 18 holes of golf. The length 
of each hole and par are given to the players. Each player 
chooses a club and the computer determines the results of the 
shot. A player can duff a shot or get a hole in one. There 
are also water hazards , rough, and sand traps. Note: It is 
sometimes very difficult to chip out of a sand trap. 

Computer Limitations 

This version of GOLF was written for a DIGITAL EduSystem 30; 
however, Statements 140 and 150 are the only ones unique to 
that system and may be easily changed. When using EduSystem 30, 
the NOLINE command must be given before running. 

Program Author 

There are several good one-player golf games. Paul Raymond 
of College St. Laurent, Quebec, submitted one and another 
has been around DIGITAL for years* However, this is the 
best multi-player version we've seen. Available from DECUS 
as BASIC 8-560, it was written by:

GOMOKO 



ORIENTAL GAME OF GO-MOKO 



Description 



GO-MOKO is a traditional game of the Orient. It is played by 
two people on a board of intersecting lines (19 left-to-right 
lines, 19 t op -to -bottom lines , 361 intersections in all). 
Players take turns. During his turn, a player may cover one 
intersection with a marker; (one player uses white markers; 
the other player uses black markers). The object of the game 
is to get five adjacent markers in a row, horizontally, ver- 
tically or along either diagonal. 

Unfortunately, this program does not make the computer a very 
good player. It does not know when you are about to win or 
even who has won. But some of its moves may surprise you. 

Computer Limitations 

This program is dimensioned (in Statement 120) for a 19x19 
board. Depending upon the size of your computer, you may have 
to scale this down. A 7x7 board is the smallest that can be 
used for a meaningful game.

GUESS 



GUESS A RANDOM NUMBER 

Description 

In Program GUESS, the computer chooses a random integer between 
and any limit you set. You must then try to guess the number 
the computer has chosen using the clues provided by the computer. 

You should be able to guess the number in one less than the 
number of digits needed to represent the number in binary 
notation — i.e., in base 2. This ought to give you a clue as 
to the optimum search technique. 

Computer Limitations 

There are no real limitations; however, the listing is from 
DIGITAL EduSystem 20 BASIC which accepts statements abbreviated 
to the first three letters.

GUNNER 



FIRE A FIELD ARTILLERY WEAPON 



Description 



These two programs allow you to adjust the fire of a field 
artillery weapon to hit a stationary or moving target/ You 
specify the number of degrees of elevation of your weapon; 
45 degrees provides maximum range with values under or over 
45 degrees providing less range. 

GUNNER is the simpler of the two programs and gives you up to 
five shots to destroy the enemy before he destroys you. Gun 
range is fixed at 46,500 yards, burst radius at 100 yards; you 
must specify elevation within approximately 0.2 degrees to get 
a hit. 

GUNERl is more complex and allows you to specify the speed at 
which your target is moving (but not directionl), and your 
burst radius. Also, your gun has a different maximum range 
randomly determined each play.

HANG 



GAME OF HANGMAN 



Description 



This is a simulation of the word guessing game, hangman. The 
computer picks a word, tells you how many letters in the word 
it has picked and then you guess a letter in the word. If you 
are right, the computer tells you where that letter belongs; 
if your letter is wrong, the computer starts to hang you. You 
get ten guesses before you are completely hanged: 

Head 

Body 

Right and Left Arms 

Right and Left Legs 

Right and Left Hands 

Right and Left Feet 

In this program, the PRINT statement is abbreviated to "Sc." 
You may add words in Data statements following Statement 508 7 
in this case, you must also change the random word selector in 
Statement 40. 

Source 

Interesting versions of Hangman were received from Brandy 
Brylawski, a seventh grader at the Eaglebrook School, Deerfield, 
Mass., and a sophisticated one from W.K. Bateman at Montpelier 
Public Schools, Montpelier, Vt. 

The one printed is from a high school sophomore:

HELLO 



CONVERSE WITH A COMPUTER 



Description 



This is a sample of one of a great number of conversational 
programs. In a sense, it is like a CAI program except that 
its responses are just good fun. Whenever a computer is ex- 
hibited at a convention or conference with people that have 
not used a computer before , the conversational programs seem 
to get the first activity. 

In this particular program, the computer dispenses advice on 
various problems such as sex, health, money, or job.

HEX 



GAME OF HEXAPAWN 



Description 

The game of Hexapawn and a method to learn a strategy for play- 
ing the game was described in "Mathematical Games" in the March 
1962 issue of Scientific American , The method described in the 
article was for a hypothetical learning machine composed of 
match boxes and colored beads. This has been generalized in 
the Program HEX. 

The program learns by elimination of bad moves. All positions 
encountered by the program and acceptable moves from them are 
stored in the array P$ (I) . When the program encounters an un- 
familiar position, the position and all legal moves from it 
are added to the list. If the program loses a game, it erases 
the move that led to defeat. If it hits a position from which 
all moves have been deleted (they all led to defeat) , it erases 
the move that got it there and resigns. Eventually, the program 
learns to play extremely well and, indeed, is unbeatable. The 
learning strategy could be adopted to other simple games with a 
finite number of moves (tic-tac-toe, small board checkers, or 
other chess-based games) . 

For complete playing directions, respond YES or Y to the ques- 
tion, INSTRUCTIONS? 

Computer Limitations 

HEX was written in BASIC -PLUS for DIGITAL RSTS-11 and RSTS/E 
systems. HEX uses string functions and concatenation extensively, 
Also, the symbol " 1 " equals REM and "&amp;" equals PRINT.

HI-LO 



HIGH/LOW JACKPOT GAME 



Description 



This game is an adaptation of the game GUESS; however , instead 
of just guessing a number between 1 and 100 , in this game you 
win dollars when you guess the number. The directions , in the 
words of the author of the game, are as follows: 

"1. There is an amount of money , between one and one 
hundred dollars , in the "HI-LO" jackpot. 

2. You will have six chances in which to guess the 
amount of money in the jackpot. 

3. After each guess, the computer will tell whether 
the guess was too high or too low. 

4. If the correct amount of money is not guessed after 
six chances, the computer will print the amount in 
the jackpot. 

5. If the correct amount of money is guessed within the 
six chance limit, the computer will register this 
amount. 

6. After each sequence of guesses, you have the choice 
of playing again or ending the program. If a new 
game is played, a new amount of money will constitute 
the j ackpot . 

7. If you win more than once, then your earnings are to- 
talled."

REMOVE PEGS ON A PEGBOARD 



Description 



This is a computerized version of an old European solitaire game 
of logic called Hi-Q. The game starts with a pegboard shaped 
like a cross having pegs in every hole but the center. The 
object is to remove all 32 pegs, or as many as possible, by 
jumping into an empty hole— the jumped peg is then removed. 

There are several different winning strategies for playing 

Hi-Q arid, of course, each strategy can be played eight different 

ways on the board. Can you find a consistent winner?

HMRABI 



GOVERN ANCIENT SUMERIA 



Description 



In this game you direct the administrator of Sumeria, Hamurabi, 
how to manage the city. The city initially has 1,000 acres, 100 
people and 3,000 bushels of grain in storage. 

You may buy and sell land with your neighboring city-states for 
bushels of grain — the price will vary between 17 and 26 bushels 
per acre. You also must use grain to feed your people and as 
seed to plant the next year's crop. 

You will quickly find that a certain number of people can only 
tend a certain amount of land and that people starve if they 
are not fed enough. You also have the unexpected to contend 
with such as a plague, rats destroying stored grain, and variable 
harvests. 

You will also find that managing just the few resources in this 
game is not a trivial job over a period of say ten years. The 
crisis of population density rears its head very rapidly.

HOCKEY 



ICE HOCKEY VS. CORNELL 



Description 



This is a simulation of a regulation, three-period ice hockey 
game. Your opponent is Cornell University. You may use three 
kinds of shots: 

1. Slap Shot 

2. Flick Shot 

3. Wrist Shot 

The game is very comprehensive starting with the face-off , and 
throughout the game with icing and high sticking penalties, 
shots hitting the post, shots being wide and being blocked 
by the goalie. 

In the event of a tie at the end of three periods, the game 
automatically goes into sudden-death overtime.

HORSES 



BETTING AT A HORSERACE 



Description 



This program simulates a one-mile horse race for three-year old 
thoroughbreds. You can place any number of bets on the outcome 
of the race. There are four elements to a bet: 

1. Horse number (1 to 8) 

2. Position (Win=l, Place=2, Show=3) 

3. Amount of wager ($2 minimum, $300 maximum) 

4. Bet signal (1 for more bets to follow/ to close 
betting) 

The computer then gives you the position of the eight horses at 
eight points around the raceway. At the end, it tells you what 
each horse paid and what you won (or didn't win) on each of your 
bets. 

Source 

The published program has been around DIGITAL for as long as 
anyone can remember. Its author is now unknown. Other interest- 
ing horse race programs were submitted by Robert Goodman, 
Southfield, Mich.; Don Viola, Staten Island, NY; and Paul 
Garmon, Wellesley Hills, Mass.

HURKLE 



FIND THE HURKLE IN HIDING 



Description 

Hurkle? A Hurkle is a happy beast and lives in another galaxy 
on a planet named Lirht that has three moons. Hurkle are 
favorite pets of the Gwik, the dominant race of Lirht and... 
well, to find out more, read "The Hurkle is a Happy Beast" 
in the book A WAY HOME by Theodore Sturgeon published by Pyramid. 

In this program a shy hurkle is hiding on a 10 by 10 grid. 
Homebase is point 0,0 in the Southwest corner. Your guess as 
to the gridpoint where the hurkle is hiding should be a pair 
of whole numbers, separated by a comma. After each try, the 
computer will tell you the approximate direction to go look 
for the Hurkle. You get five guesses to find him.

THROW A BALL UP IN THE AIR 



Description 

This program tests your fundamental knowledge of kinematics. 
It presents a simple problem: a ball is thrown straight up 
in the air at some random velocity. You then must answer 
three questions about the flight of the ball: 

1. How high will it go? 

2. How long until it returns to earth? 

3. What will be its velocity after a random number of 
seconds? 

The computer evaluates your performance; within 15% of the 
correct answer is considered close enough. After each run, 
the computer gives you another problem until you interrupt 
the program.

KING 



GOVERN YOUR OWN ISLAND 



Description 

This is one of the more comprehensive, difficult , and interesting 
land and resource management games, (If you've never played one 
of these games, start with HMRABI). 

In this game, you are Premier of Setats Detinu, a small communist 
island 30 by 70 miles long. Your job is to decide upon the 
budget of the country and distribute money to your countrymen 
from the communal treasury. 

The money system is Rallods; each person needs 100 Rallods 
per year to survive. Your country's income comes from farm 
produce and tourists visiting your magnificent forests, hunting, 
fishing, etc. Part of your land is farm land but it also has 
an excellent mineral content and may be sold to foreign industry 
for strip mining. Industry import and support their own workers. 
Crops cost between 10 and 15 Rallods per square mile to plant, 
cultivate, and harvest. Your goal is to complete an eight-year 
term of office without major mishap. 

To the question, "HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU PLAYED?" answer "0" 
for a full set of rules, "500" for no explanation, or " 1,000" 
to continue an old game. To stop a running game and continue 
it later, answer "0" to all questions. 

This program is available from DECUS as BASIC-8-346, and is 
called "POLLUTION GAME."

LETTER 



LETTER GUESSING GAME 



Description 



LETTER is similar to the game GUESS in which you guess a number 
chosen by the computer; in this program, the computer picks a 
random letter of the alphabet and you must guess which one it 
is using the clues provided as you go along. It should not 
take you more than five guesses to get the mystery letter. 

Computer Limitations 

This program was adapted for DIGITAL EduSystem 15/30/35 and 
uses the automatic character string to ASCII conversion feature. 
Other systems will require a conversion function as Statement 
435.

LIFE 



JOHN CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE 

Description 

The Game of Life was originally described in Scientific American , 
October 1970, in an article by Martin Gardner. The game itself 
was originated by John Conway of Gonville and Caius College, 
University of Cambridge, England. 

In the "manual" game, organisms exist in the form of counters 
(chips or checkers) on a large checkerboard and die or reproduce 
according to some simple genetic rules. Conway's criteria for 
choosing his genetic laws were carefully delineated as follows: 

1. There should be no initial pattern for which there is 

a simple proof that the population can grow without limit, 

2. There should be initial patterns that apparently do 
grow without limit. 

3. There should be simple initial patterns that grow and 
change for a considerable period of time before coming 

to an end in three possible ways: fading away completely 
(from overcrowding or from becoming too sparse) , settling 
into a stable configuration that remains unchanged 
thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in which 
they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods. 

In brief , the rules should be such as to make the behavior of 
the population unpredictable. Conway's genetic laws are de- 
lightfully simple. First note that each cell of the checker- 
board (assumed to be an infinite plane) has eight neighboring 
cells, four adjacent orthogonally, four adjacent diagonally. 
The rules are: 

1. Survivals. Every counter with two or three neighboring 
counters survives for the next generation* 

2 . Deaths . Each counter with four or more ne ighbor s dies 
(is removed) from overpopulation. Every counter with 
one neighbor or none dies from isolation. 

3. Births. Each empty cell adjacent to exactly three 
neighbors— no more, no fewer—is a birth cell. A 
counter is placed on it at the next move. 

It is important to understand that all births and deaths occur 
s imultaneously . Together they constitute a s ingle generation or , 
as we shall call it, a "move" in the complete "life history" 
o f the initial configuration. 



143 



You will find the population constantly undergoing unusual , 
sometimes beautiful and always unexpected change. In a few 
cases the society eventually dies out (all counters vanishing) , 
although this may not happen until after a great many generations, 
Most starting patterns either reach stable figures* — Conway calls 
them "still lifes" — that cannot change or patterns that oscillate 
forever. Patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become 
symmetrical. Once this happens the symmetry cannot be lost, 
although it may increase in richness. 

Conway used a DIGITAL PDP-7 with a graphic display to observe 
long-lived populations. The program here is programmed for a 
RSTS-11 system. You simply input your initial pattern and ter- 
minate your input with a Control/Z. The computer then plots 
successive generations of your population on a 24 (vertical) 
by 70 (horizontal) grid. Sit back and watch it!

LIFE-2 



2 -PERSON GAME OF LIFE 



Description 



LIFE-2 is based on Conway's game of Life. You must be familiar 
with the rules of LIFE before attempting to play LIFE-2. 

There are two players; the game is played on a 5x5 board and each 
player has a symbol to represent his own pieces of 'life 1 . Live 
cells belonging to player 1 are represented by '*' and live cells 
belonging to player 2 are represented by the symbol '#' . 

The # and * are regarded as the same except when deciding whether 
to generate a live cell. An empty cell having twb'-' r #' and one 
**' for neighbors will generate a '#' , i.e. the live cell generated 
belongs to the player who has the majority of the 3 live cells 
surrounding the empty cell where life is to be generated', e.g. 





1 


2 


3 


4 


5 


1 












2 






* 






3 








# 




4 






# 






5 













A new cell will be generated at (3,3) which will be a '#' since 
there are two '#' and one '*' surrounding. The board will then 
become: 





1 


2 


3 


4 


5 


1 












2 












3 






# 


# 




4 












5 













146 



On the first move each player positions 3 pieces of life on the 
board by typing in the co-ordinates of the pieces. (In the event 
of the same cell being chosen by both players that cell is left 
empty . ) 

The board is then adjusted to the next generation and printed out. 

On each subsequent turn each player places one piece on the board, 
the object being to annihilate his opponent's pieces. The board 
is adjusted for the next generation and printed out after both 
players have entered their new piece. 

The game continues until one player has no more live pieces. The 
computer will then print out the board and declare the winner.

MATH 1)1 



PICTORIAL ADDITION PRACTICE 



Description 



The program presents pictorial drill on addition facts uping 
printed dice with no reading involved. It is good for beginning 
addition, since the answer can be derived from counting spots 
on the dice as well as by memorizing math facts or awareness of 
number concepts. It is especially effective run on an alpha- 
numeric CRT terminal.

MNOPLY 



GAME OF MONOPOLY 



Description 



MNOPLY is a simulation of the most popular board game in the 
world, Monopoly. It varies from the actual game only in that 
two players are the maximum number that can play. 

The dialog during the game presents complete rules and instruc- 
tions. The inputs are designed so that when anything except the 
required input is typed in, the entire segment will be ignored. 
When questions are asked about property to be sold, the full 
name is required— e.g. , STATES AVENUE. 

In the computer game, you always pay $50 to get out of jail 
unless you have a "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" card. No double rolls. 

As in the board game, before you can improve your property 
(build houses), you must own all of the pieces of that color 
property--!. e. , have a monopoly of a particular color group. 
The program will automatically ignore attempts to build houses 

if you don't have a color group monopoly. Here are the color 
groups for your reference: 



Purple: 

BALTIC AVE 

MEDITERRANEAN AVE 
Light Blue: 

ORIENTAL AVE 

VERMONT AVE 

CONNECTICUT AVE 
Maroon: 

ST. CHARLES PL 

STATES AVE 

VIRGINIA AVE 
Orange: 

ST. JAMES PL 

TENNESSEE AVE 

NEW YORK AVE 



Red: 

KENTUCKY AVE 

INDIANA AVE 

ILLINOIS AVE 
Yellow: 

ATLANTIC AVE 

VENTNOR AVE 

MARVIN GARDENS 
Green: 

PACIFIC AVE 

NORTH CAROLINA AVE 

PENNSYLVANIA AVE 
Dark Blue: 

PARK PL 

BOARDWALK 



Computer Limitations 

MNOPLY was written for DIGITAL RSTS-11 or RSTS/E. It requires 
two virtual memory files which are built via the file-building 
program.

MUGWMP 



FIND 4 MUGWUMPS IN HIDING 



Description 



Your objective in this game is to find the four Mugwumps hiding 
on various squares of a 10 by 10 grid. Homebase (lower left) is 
position (0,0) and a guess is a pair of whole numbers (0 to 9), 
separated by commas. The first number is the number of units 
to the right of homebase and the second number is the distance 
above homebase. 

You get ten guesses to locate the four Mugwumps ; after each guess , 
the computer tells you how close you are to each Mugwump. Play- 
ing the game with the aid of graph paper and a compass should 
allow you to find all the Mugwumps in six or seven moves using 
triangulation — i.e., like LORAN radio navigation.

NICOMA 



COMPUTER GUESSES YOUR NUMBER 



Description 

One of the most ancient forms of arithmetical puzzle is sometimes 
referred to as a "boomerang . " At some time, everyone has been 
asked to "think of a number # " and, after going through some 
process of private calculation, to state the result, after which 
the questioner promptly tells you the number you originally 
thought of. There are hundreds of varieties of the puzzle. 

The oldest recorded example appears to be that given in Arithmetica 
of Nicomachus, who died about the year 120. He tells you to 
think of any whole number between 1 and 100 and divide it suc- 
cessively by 3, 5, and 7 , telling him the remainder in each case. 
On receiving this information, he promptly discloses the number 
you thought of. 

Can you discover a simple method of mentally performing this feat? 
If not, you can see how the ancient mathematician did it by look- 
ing at Lines 80-100 of the program.

NIM 



CHINESE GAME OF NIM 

Description 

NIM is one of the oldest two-person games known to man; it is 
believed to have originated in ancient China. The name, which 
was coined by the first mathematician to analyze it, comes from 
an archaic English verb which means to steal or to take away. 
Objects are arranged in rows between the two opponents as in 
the following example: 

X X X X X X X Row 1 — 7 Objects 

X X X X X Row 2 — 5 Objects 

XXX Row 3 — 3 Objects 

X Row 4 — 1 Object 

Opponents take turns removing objects until there are none 
left. The one who picks up the last object wins. The moves 
are made according to the following two rules: 

1. On any given turn only objects from one row may be 
removed. There is no restriction on which row or on 
how many objects you remove. Of course, you cannot 
remove more than are in the row. 

2. You cannot skip a move or remove zero objects. 

The winning strategy can be mathematically defined, however, 
rather than presenting it here, we'd rather let you find it 
on your own. HINT: Play a few games with the computer and 
mark down on a piece of paper the number of objects in each 
stack (in binaryl) after each move. Do you see a pattern 
emerging? 

Source 

One of the most popular computer games. Over 10 versions of 
NIM were submitted. One notable one came from Larry Ruane, 
Mt. Prospect, Illinois, who programmed NIM for a DIGITAL 
EduSystem 10. Quite a featl The one published is from:

THIS PROGRAM PLAYS NIM. 

DO YOU WANT INSTRUCTIONS? YES 

NIM IS PLAYED BY TWO PEOPLE PLAYING ALTERNATELY. BEFORE 
THE PLAY STARTS* AN ARBITRARY NUMBER OF STICKS OR OBJECTS IS 
PUT INTO AN ARBITRARY NUMBER OF PILES* IN ANY DISTRIBUTION 
WHATEVER. THEN EACH PLAYER IN HIS TURN REMOVES AS MANY 
STICKS AS HE WISHES FROM ANY PILE--BUT FROM ONLY ONE PILE* 
AND AT LEAST ONE STICK. THE PLAYER WHO TAKES THE LAST STICK 
IS THE WINNER. 

THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS YOU TO SET UP THE INITIAL ARRANGEMENT 
OF PILES AND STICKS. IT WILL NOT ACCEPT MORE THAN TWENTY 
PILES OR STICKS IN EACH PILE.

RANDOM NUMBER GAME 



Description 

In contrast to other . number guessing games where you keep guess- 
ing until you get the random number selected by the computer 
(GUESS/ TRAP, STARS, etc.), in this game you get only one guess 
per play and you gain or lose points depending upon how close 
your guess is to the random number selected by the computer. 
You occasionally get a jackpot which will double your point 
count. You win when you get 500 points.

Description 



In this game or puzzle, 48 checkers are placed on the two 
outside spaces of a standard 64-square checkerboard as shown: 



The object is to remove as many checkers as possible by- 
diagonal jumps (as in standard checkers). 

It is easy to remove 30 to 39 checkers , a challenge to 
remove 40 to 44, and a substantial feat to remove 45 to 47,

ing a planet at a constant altitude and orbital rate (degrees/ 
hour) . The location of the ship is hidden by a device that 
renders the ship invisible, but after each bomb you are told 
how close to the enemy ship your bomb exploded. The challenge 
is to hit an invisible moving target with a limited number of 
shots. 

The planet can be replaced by a point at its center (called the 
origin) ; then the ship's position can be given as a distance 
from the origin and an angle between its position and the 
eastern edge of the planet.

The distance of the bomb from the ship is computed using the 
law of cosines (see line 430 of the program listing) . The law 
of cosines states

where D is the distance between the ship and the bomb, R is the 
altitude of the ship, Dl is the altitude of the bomb, and A-Al 
is the angle between the ship and the bomb.

DELIVER PIZZAS IN HYATTSVILLE 



Description 

In this game, you take orders for pizzas from people living in 
Hyattsville. Armed with a map of the city, you must then tell 
a delivery boy the address where the pizza is to be delivered. 
If the pizza is delivered to the correct address, the customer 
phones you and thanks you; if not, you must give the driver 
the correct address until the pizza gets delivered. 

Some interesting modifications suggest themselves for this 
program such as pizzas getting cold after two incorrect delivery 
attempts or taking three or more orders at a time and figuring 
the shortest delivery route. Send us your modifications!

This program seems to have surfaced originally at the University 
of Georgia in Athens, GA. The author is unknown.

RANDOM POETRY (HAIKU) 



Description 



POETRY: This program will randomly choose a singlet, couplet, 
or quatrain from a set of 23 preset PRINT statements. It spaces 
at random intervals, but ends at approximately the same point 
each time. There is a low likelihood of duplication of lines. 

POET: This program produces random verse which might loosely 
be considered in the Japanese Haiku style. It uses 20 phrases 
in four groups of five phrases each generally cycling through 
the groups. It inserts commas (random— -19% of the time), 
indentation (random — 22% of the time) , and starts new para- 
graphs (18% probability, but at least every 20 phrases). 

The version of POET published has phrases suggestive of Edgar 
Allen Poe. Try it with phrases from computer technology, from 
love and romance, from four-year-old children, or from some 
other subject. Send us the output: 

Here are some phrases from nature to try: 



Carpet of ferns 
Morning dew 
Tang of dawn 
Swaying pines 

Entrances me 
Soothing me 
Rustling leaves 
Radiates calm

Grace and beauty 
Silently singing 
Nature speaking 

Untouched, unspoiled 
Shades of green 
Tranquility 
. . .so peaceful

POKER 



PLAY DRAW POKER 



Description 



In this game, you play draw poker with the computer as your 
opponent. At the start of the game, each person has $200. 
The game ends when either opponent runs out of money (if you 
run short, the computer gives you a chance to sell your 
wristwatch or diamond tie tack). 

The computer opens the betting before the draw; you open the 
betting after the draw. If you don't have a hand that's worth 
anything and want to fold, bet 0. Prior to the draw, to check 
the draw, you may bet .5. Of course, if the computer has 
betted, you must match bets (see his bet) in order to draw or, 
if your hand looks good either before or after the draw, you 
may always raise the bet.

QUBIC 



3 -DIMENSIONAL TIC-TAC-TOE 



Description 



QUBIC is the game of tic-tac-toe in a 4x4x4 cube. You must get 
4 markers in a row or diagonal along any 3 -dimensional plane 
in order to win. It is up to you to keep track of moves (the 
program does not print out a diagram as you play). 

Each move is indicated by a 3 -dig it number (digits not separated 
by commas), with each digit between 1 and 4 inclusive. The 
digits indicate the level, column, and row, respectively, of 
the move. You can win if you play correctly; although, it is 
considerably more difficult than standard, two-dimensional 3x3 
tic-tac-toe. 

Source 

QUBIC seems to have first shown up on a G.E. timesharing system 
in 1968. Its original author is unknown.

QUEEN 



ONE CHESS QUEEN 



Description 



This game is based on the permissible moves of the chess queen — 
i.e., along any vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. In this game, 
the queen can only move to the left, down, and diagonally down 
to the left. 

The object of the game is to place the queen (one only) in the 
lower left-hand square (no. 150), by alternating moves between 
you and the computer. The one to place the queen there wins. 

You go first and place the queen in any one of the squares on 
the top row or the right-hand column. That is your first move. 
The computer is beatable, but it takes some figuring. See if 
you can devise a winning strategy.

REVRSE 



_ ORDER A LIST OF NUMBERS 

Description 

The game of REVERSE requires you to arrange a list of numbers 
in numerical order from left to right. To move, you tell the 
computer how many numbers (counting from the left) to reverse. 
For example, if the current list is: 

2 3 4 5 16 7 8 9 
and you reverse 4, the result will be: 

543216789 

Now if you reverse 5, you win! 

There are many ways to beat the game, but approaches tend to be 
either algorithmic or heuristic. The game thus offers the player 
a chance to play with these concepts in a practical (rather than 
theoretical) context. 

An algorithmic approach guarantees a solution in a predictable 
number of moves, given the number of items in the list. For 
example, one method guarantees a solution in 2N - 3 moves when 
the list contains N numbers. The essence of an algorithmic 
approach is that you know in advance what your next move will 
be. One could easily program a computer to do this. 

A heuristic approach takes advantage of "partial orderings" in 
the list at any moment. Using this type of approach, your next 
move is dependent on the way the list currently appears. This 
way of solving the problem does not guarantee a solution in a 
predictable number of moves, but if you are lucky and clever, 
you may come out ahead of the algorithmic solutions. One could 
not so easily program this method. 

In practice, many players adopt a "mixed" strategy, with both 
algorithmic and heuristic features. Is this better than either 
"pure " strategy?

ROCKET 



.LAND AN APOLLO CAPSULE ON THE MOON 

Description 

ROCKET , known also as LUNAR, LEM, and APOLLO, is by far and away 
the single most popular computer game. It exists in versions 
that start you anywhere from 500 feet to 200 miles above the 
moon, or other planets, too. Some allow the control of directional 
stabilization rockets and/or the retro rocket. The three versions 
presented here appear to be the most popular of the many varia- 
tions. 

ROCKET. In this program, you set the burn rate of the retro 
rockets (pounds of fuel per second) every 10 seconds and attempt 
to achieve a soft landing on the moon. 200 lbs/s^c really puts 
the brakes on, and lbs/sec is free fall. Ignition occurs at 
8 lbs/sec, so do not use burn rates between 1 and 7 lbs/sec. 
To make the landing more of a challenge, but more closely ap- 
proximate the real Apollo LEM capsule, you should make the 
available fuel at the start (N) equal to 16,000 lbs, and the 
weight of the capsule (M) equal to 32,500 lbs in Statement 15. 

Some computers object to the series expansion calculations in 
Statements 91 and 94 (as you near the lunar surface, these 
numbers get very small) . If yours does, substitute the expanded 
form — for the expansion in Statement 91: 

-Q* (1+Q* (1/2+Q* (1/3+Q* (1/4+Q/5) ) ) ) 

You should be able to figure the other one out yourself . 

ROCKT1. In this version, you start 500 feet above the lunar 
surface and control the burn rate in 1-second bursts. Each unit 
of fuel slows your descent by 1 ft/sec. The maximum thrust of 
your engine is 30 ft/sec/sec. 

ROCKT2. This is the most comprehensive of the three versions 
and permits you to control the time interval of firing, the 
thrust, and the attitude angle. It also allows you to work in 
the metric or English system of measurement. The instructions 
in the program dialog are very complete, so you shouldn't have 
any trouble. 

In most versions of ROCKET, the temptation is to slow up too 
soon and then have no fuel left for the lower part of the 
journey. This, of course, is disasterous (as you will find out 
when you land your own capsule) I

confidence that ROCKET was originally written in FOCAL by a

GAME OF ROCK, SCISSORS, PAPER 



Description 

Remember the game of rock-scissors-paper. You and your opponent 
make a motion three times with your fists and then either show 
a flat hand (paper), fist (rock), or two fingers (scissors)* 
Depending upon what is shown, the game is a tie (both show the 
same) or one person wins. Paper wraps up rock, so it wins. 
Scissors cut paper, so it wins. And rock breaks scissors, 
so it wins . 

In this computerized version of rock-scissors-paper, you can 
play up to ten games vs. the computer.

ROULET 



EUROPEAN ROULETTE TABLE 



Description 



This game simulates a European Roulette wheel; "European" because 
it has 37 number compartments (1 to 36 and 0) • The American 
wheel has 38 numbers (1 to 36, and 00). The Bahamas, Puerto 
Rico, and South American countries are slowly switching to the 
American wheel because it gives the house a bigger percentage. 
Odd and even numbers alternate around the wheel, as do red and 
black. The layout of the wheel insures a highly random number 
pattern. In fact, roulette wheels are sometimes used to generate 
tables of random numbers. 

In this game, you may bet from $1 to $10,000 and you may bet on 
red or black, odd or even, a column, or single number. 

There is no long-range winning strategy for playing roulette. 
However, a good strategy is that of "doubling." First spin, 
bet $1 on an even/odds bet (odd, even, red, or black). If you 
lose, double your bet to $2. If you lose again, double to $4. 
Continue to double until you win (i.e., you break even on a 
losing sequence). As soon as you win, bet $1 again, and after 
every win, bet $1. Do not ever bet more than $1 unless you are 
recuperating losses by doubling. Do not ever bet anything but 
the even odds bets. Good luck I 

Source 

Like so many other games of chance, computerized ROULET has been 
around a long time in FORTRAN, LISP, and so on. Its original 
author is unknown today.

Description 

In this game, you are given by the computer a revolver loaded 
with one bullet and five empty chambers. You spin the chamber 
and pull the trigger by inputting a "1," or, if you want to 
quit, input a "2." You win if you play ten times and are still 
alive.

SALVO 



NAVAL GUN BATTLE 



Description 



The rules are not explained by the program, so read carefully 
this description by Larry Siege 1, the program author. 

"SALVO is played on a 10x10 grid or board using an x,y coordinate 
system. The player has 4 ships: battleship (5 squares), cruiser 
(3 squares), and two destroyers (2 squares each). The ships 
must be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally and must 
not overlap. The ships do not move during the game. 

"As long as any square of a battleship still survives, the player 
is allowed three shots, for a cruiser 2 shots, and for each 
destroyer 1 shot. Thus, at the beginning of the game the player 
has 3+2+1+1=7 shots. The player enters all of his shots and 
the computer tells what was hit." A shot is entered by its grid 
coordinates, x,y. The winner is the one who sinks all of the 
opponent's ships. 

Important note: Your ships and the computer's ships are located 
on 2 separate 10x10 boards. For a simpler version of this game, 
try SALV01.

SALVO 1 



ARMY GUN BATTLE 



Description 



SALV01 is played on two, 5x5 grids or boards with 25 outpost 
locations numbered 1 to 25. Both you and the computer have 
four platoons of troops that can be located at any four out- 
posts on your respective grids. 

At the start of the game, you locate (or hide) your four 
platoons on your grid. The computer does the same on its 
grid. You then take turns firing missiles or bonibs at each 
other's outposts trying to destroy all four platoons. The 
one who finds all four opponent's platoons first, wins.

SLOTS 



SLOT MACHINE 

Description 

The slot machine or one-arm bandit is a mechanical device that 
will absorb coins just about as fast as you can feed it. After 
inserting a coin, you pull a handle that sets three independent 
reels spinning. If the reels stop with certain symbols appear- 
ing in the pay line, you get a certain payoff. The original 
slot machine, called the Liberty Bell, was invented in 1895 
by Charles Fey in San Francisco. Fey refused to sell or lease 
the manufacturing rights, so H.S. Mills in Chicago built a 
similar, but much improved, machine called the Operators Bell. 
This has survived nearly unchanged to today. 

On the Operators Bell and other standard slot machines, there 
are 20 symbols on each wheel but they are not distributed 
evenly among the objects (cherries, bar, apples, etc.). Of 
the 8,000 possible combinations, the expected payoff (to the 
player) is 7,049 or $89.11 for every $100.00 put in, one of the 
lowest expected payoffs of all casino games. 

In the program here, the payoff is considerably more liberal; 
indeed it favors the player by 11% — i.e., an expected payoff 
of $111 for each $100 bet. To approximate Nevada odds, reduce 
the jackpot to $15 and keno to $4. 

Source 

Lots of slot machine programs were submitted including a very 
nice one by Rob Hof fberg of Roslyn, NY. The author of the 
one published is unknown.

PICTURE OF SNOOPY 



Description 

There must be 7,000 various computer pictures of Snoopy around 
dating from the ENIAC I. Just why Snoopy was universally 
adopted as the programmers 1 mascot is hard to say, but it's 
clear today that he was- -overwhelmingly! Here are a couple 
of pictures of that ubiquitous dog.

SPACWR 



SPACEWAR BASED ON STAR TREK 



Description 



This program is an incredibly complete version of spacewar. 
You are Captain Kirk of the Starship Enterprise and have as 
your mission to destroy a certain number of enemy Klingon 
spaceships (generally around 24) and thus keep the galaxy safe 
for democracy. You must complete your mission in 30 stardates 
(measure of time in space — -think of it as a day). 

The galaxy is divided into 64 quadrants arranged in an 8x8 grid. 
Each quadrant is in turn divided into 64 sectors, also in an 
8x8 grid arrangement. It, of course, costs time and fuel to get 
from one quadrant to another. 

Complete playing instructions are given if you answer YES to 
the question, DO YOU WANT INSTRUCTIONS? 

Note: This program appears to have one or two minor bugs. It's 
eminently usable, but occasionally funny little things happen.

SPLAT 



OPEN A PARACHUTE AT THE LAST MOMENT 



Description 



SPLAT simulates a parachute jump in which you try to open your 
'chute at the last possible moment without going splat I You 
may select your own terminal velocity or let the computer do 
it for you. You may also select the acceleration due to gravity 
or, again, let the computer do it in which case you might wind 
up on any of the eight planets (out to Neptune) , the moon, or 
sun. 

The computer then tells you the height you're jumping from and 
asks for the seconds of free fall. It then divides your free 
fall time into eight intervals and gives you progress reports 
on your way down. The computer also keeps track of all prior 
jumps in the file PARACH.UTE and lets you know how you compared 
with previous successful jumps.

A NUMBER GUESSING GAME 



Description 



In this game, the computer selects a random number from 1 to 100 
(or any value you set in Statement 150). You try to guess the 
number and the computer gives you clues to tell you how close 
you're getting. One star (*) means you're far away from the 
number; seven stars (*******) means you're really close. You 
get 7 guesses. 

On the surface this game is very similar to GUESS; however , the 
guessing strategy is quite different. See if you can come up 
with one or more approaches to finding the mystery number.

PLAY THE STOCK MARKET 



Description 



This program "plays" the stock market. You will be given $10,000 
and may buy or sell stocks. Stock prices and trends are generated 
randomly; therefore, this model does not represent exactly what 
happens on the exchange. (Depending upon your point of view, you 
may feel this is quite a good representation!) 

Every trading day, a table of stocks, their prices, and number of 
shares in your portfolio is printed. Following this, the initials 
of each stock are printed followed by a question mark. You in- 
dicate your transaction in number of shares — a positive number 
to buy, negative number to sell, or to do no trading. A 
brokerage fee of 1% is charged on all transactions (a bargain!). 
Note: Even if the value of a stock drops to zero, it may re- 
bound again — then again, it may not.

SYNONM 



WORD SYNONYMS 



Description 

A synonym of a word is another word in the English language 
which has the same, or very nearly the same, meaning. This 
program tests your knowledge of synonyms of a few common words. 

The computer chooses a word and asks you for a synonym. The 
computer then tells you whether you're right or wrong. If you 
can't think of a synonym, type "HELP" which causes a synonym 
to be printed. 

You may put in words of your choice in the data statements (510-600) 
The number following DATA in Statement 500 is the total number 
of data statements. In each data statement, the first number 
is the number of words in that statement. 

Can you think of a way to make this into a more general kind of 
CAI program for any subject?

TARGET 



DESTROY A TARGET IN 3-D SPACE 



Description 



In this program, you are firing a weapon from a spaceship in 
3-dimensional space. Your ship, the Starship Enterprise, is 
located at the origin (0,0,0) of a set of x,y,z coordinates. 
You will be told the approximate location of the target in 
3-dimensional rectangular coordinates, the approximate angular 
deviation from the x and z axes in both radius and degrees, 
and the approximate distance to the target. 

Given this information, you then proceed to shoot at the target, 
A shot within 20 kilometers of the target destroys it. After 
each shot, you are given information as to the position of the 
explosion of your shot and a somewhat improved estimate of the 
location of the target. Fortunately, this is just practice 
and the target doesn't shoot back. After you have attained 
proficiency, you ought to be able to destroy a target in 3 or 4 
shots. However, attaining proficiency might take a while!

Description 



3DPLOT will plot the family of curves of any function. The 
function Z is plotted as "rising" out of the x-y plane with 
x and y inside a circle of radius 30. The resultant plot looks 
almost 3 -dimensional. 

You set the function you want plotted in line 5. As with any 
mathematical plot, some functions come out "prettier" than 
others. Here are some that work nicely: 

5 DEF FNA(Z) = 30*EXP (-Z*Z/100) 

5 DEF FNA(Z) = SQR (900.01-Z*Z) *. 9-2 

5 DEF FNA(Z) = 30* (COS (Z/16) ) t2 

5 DEF FNA(Z) = 30-30*SIN (Z/18) 

5 DEF FNA(Z) = 30*EXP (-COS (Z/16) ) -30 

(Bessel function — Summerfeld's Integral) 

5 DEF FNA(Z) = 30*SIN (Z/10) 

One of the shortest programs submitted (14 lines) , 3DPL0T has 
to rank as perhaps the most clever.

TIC TAC 



TIC -TAG -TOE 



Description 



The game of tic-tac-toe hardly needs any introduction. In this 
one, you play versus the computer. Moves are entered by row 
number, a comma, and column number, as in the diagram below. 



1,1 1,2 1,3 
2,1 2,2 2,3 
3,1 3,2 3,3 



If you make any bad moves, the computer will win; if the com- 
puter makes a bad move, you can win; otherwise, the game ends 
in a tie. 

Source 

Seven games of tic-tac-toe were submitted. One notable one by 
Chase Ambler of the Asheville School plays the game on a VT05 
CRT terminal while an abbreviated one by Dana Noftle fits into 
an EduSystem 10.

TOWER 



TOWERS OF HANOI PUZZLE 



Description 

This is a simulation of a game of logic that originated in the 
middle East. It is sometimes called Pharoah's Needles, but 
its most common name is the Towers of Hanoi. 

Legend has it that a secret society of monks live beneath the 
city of Hanoi. They possess three large towers or needles on 
which different size gold disks may be placed. Moving one at 
a time and never placing a larger on a smaller disk, the monks 
endeavor to move the tower of disks from the left needle to 
the right needle. Legend says when they have finished moving 
this 64-disk tower, the world will end. How many moves will 
they have to make to accomplish this? If they can move 1 
disk per minute and work 24 hours per day, how many years 
will it take? 



In the computer puzzle you are faced with three upright needles. 
On the leftmost needle are placed from two to seven graduated 
disks, the largest being on the bottom and smallest on the top. 
Your object is to move the entire stack of disks to the right- 
most needle. However, you may only move one disk at a time 
and you may never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. 

In this computer game, the disks are referred 
to by their size — -i.e., the smallest is 3, 
next 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. If you play 
with fewer than 7 disks always use the largest, 
i.e. with 2 disks you would use nos. 13 and 
15. The program instructions are self- 
explanatory. Good luck I

TRAIN 



TIME-SPEED-DISTANCE QUIZ 



Description 

TRAIN is a program which uses the computer to generate problems 
with random initial conditions to teach about the time-speed- 
distance relationship (distance = rate x time). You then input 
your answer and the computer verifies your response. 

TRAIN is merely an example of a student-generated problem. 
Maximum fun (and benefit) comes more from writing programs 
like this as opposed to solving the specific problem posed. 
Exchange your program with others - you solve their problem 
and let them solve yours. 

Source 

TRAIN was originally written in FOCAL by one student for use 
by others in his class. It was submitted to us by:

TRAP 



TRAP A MYSTERY NUMBER 



Description 



Another of the family of "guess the mystery number" games, in 
TRAP the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100 
(or other limit set in statement 20) . Your object is to find 
the number. On each guess, you enter 2 numbers trying to 
trap the mystery number between your two trap numbers. The 
computer will tell you if its number is larger or smaller 
than your trap numbers or if you have trapped the number. 

To win the game, you must guess the mystery number by entering 
it as the same value for both of your trap numbers. You get 
6 guesses (this should be changed in statement 10 if you 
change the guessing limit in statement 20). 

After you have played GUESS, STARS, and TRAP, compare the 
guessing strategy you have found best for each game. Do you 
notice any similarities? What are the differences? Can you 
write a new guessing game with still another approach? 

Program Author 

TRAP was suggested by 10-year old when he was playing GUESS. 
It was originally programmed by Steve Ullman and extensively 
modified into its final form by:

GAME OF 23 MATCHES 



Description 



In the game of twenty- three matches, you start with 23 matches 
lying on a table. On each turn, you may take 1, 2, or 3 matches. 
You alternate moves with the computer and the one who has to 
take the last match loses. 

The easiest way to devise a winning strategy is to start at 
the end of the game. Since you wish to leave the last match 
to your opponent, you would like to have either 4, 3, or 2 
on your last turn so you can take away 3, 2, or 1 and leave 
1. Consequently, you would like to leave your opponent with 
5 on his next to last turn so, no matter what his move, you 
are left with 4, 3, or 2. Work this backwards to the begin- 
ning and you'll find the game can effectively be won on the 
first move. Fortunately, the computer gives you the first 
move, so if you play wisely, you can win. 

After you've mastered 23 Matches, move on to BATNUM and then 
to NIM.

UGLY 



DRAWS AN UGLY WOMAN 



Description 

This program draws on the terminal the profile of a woman. 
It gives you an opportunity to specify the "dimensions" of 
your woman (termed SPECIAL) or take your chances (CHANCE) . 

The computer draws your figure and then makes a determination 
whether or not to call your woman ugly or just leave it up to 
your own judgement.

WAR 



CARD GAME OF WAR 



Description 



This program plays the card game of War. In War, the card 
deck is shuffled, then two cards are dealt, one to each 
player. Players compare cards and the higher card (numeri- 
cally) wins. In case of tie, no one wins. The game ends 
when you have gone through the whole deck (52 cards, 26 
games) or when you decide to quit. 

The computer gives cards by suit and number, for example, 
5-7 is the 7 of spades. 

Note: The fG in some of the PRINT statements (470,650) 
indicates the ringing of the teletype bell.

WAR 2 



TROOP TACTICS IN WAR 



Description 

In this game, you are fighting a small-scale war with the 
computer. You have 72 # 000 troops which you first must 
distribute into your Army, Navy, and Air Force. You may 
distribute them in any way you choose as long as you don't 
use more than 72,000. 

You then attach your opponent (the computer) and input 
which service and the number of men you wish to use. The 
computer then tells you the outcome of the battle, gives 
you the current statistics and allows you to determine 
your next move. 

After the second battle, it is decided from the total 
statistics whether you win or lose or if a treaty is signed.

WEKDAY 



FACTS ABOUT YOUR BIRTHDAY 



Description 



This program gives facts about your date of birth (or some 
other day of interest) . It is not prepared to give informa- 
tion on people born before the use of the current type of 
calendar, i.e. year 1582. 

You merely enter today's date in the form - month, day, 
year and your date of birth in the same form. The computer 
then tells you the day of the week of your birth date, your 
age, and how much time you have spent sleeping, eating, 
working, and relaxing.

WORD 



WORD GUESSING GAME 



Description 



WORD is similar to Hangman in that the player must guess 
a word with clues as to letter position furnished by the 
computer. However, instead of guessing one letter at a time, 
in WORD, you guess an entire word (or group of 5 letters, 
such as ABCDE) . The computer will tell you if any letters 
in your word are in the mystery word and if any of them are 
in the correct position. Armed with these clues, you go on 
guessing until you get the word or, if you can't get it, 
input a n ?" and the computer will tell you the mystery word. 

You may change the words in Data Statements 512 and 513, but 
they must be 5-letter words.

YAHTZE 



DICE GAME OF YAHTZEE 



Description 

Yahtzee may be played by up to 15 people. The object of the 
game is to get the highest grand total score. Each player 
on his turn receives from the computer the values of 5 
pseudo dice. He may then roll as many of them as he wants 
to again. This may be repeated once again (3 rolls maximum), 
To roll again, you tell the computer how many dice you want 
to re-roll or change and the number of each die. You play 
13 rounds for a complete game. 

After you have finished rolling, you must decide how you 
want to score the five dice. Typing "SUMMARY" will show 
you which categories have been used, otherwise, you must 
decide on one of 13 categories or "ZERO" to eliminate a 
category with no score.

ZOOP 



BASIC PROGRAMMER'S NIGHTMARE 

Description 

ZOOP is designed to imitate the system commands of a BASIC 
compiler # however, it gives totally meaningless and frustrating 
results. For example, to the command: 

CAT 

ZOOP responds with: 

TRY MONTGOMERY WARD ' S 

To the command : 

SCRATCH 

ZOOP responds with: 

GOT AN ITCH? 

Computer Limitations 

The version of ZOOP printed here was written for DIGITAL 
Edusys terns 15/30/35 and immediately decodes the first two 
characters input and carries on from there. It is a simple 
matter to convert ZOOP to a system which has string handling, 
however, it was felt that this version is more creative. It 
also happens to be the original.

INSTRUCTIONS TO GAME AUTHORS 



1. Programs must be complete and debugged / BASIC language only. 



2. 



3. 



4. 



5. 



6, 



7. 



8- 



Please submit: 

A. One program listing and 

B. Two sample runs the way an average person would play. 

Listing and run must be on white , un lined paper. If you have 
lined paper, turn it around to the un lined side. We 
absolutely cannot handle submittals on pink, yellow, blue 
or gray paper. Xerox, Ditto, or other copies are also 
unacceptable. Make as few folds in the output as possible. 

Listing and run must be done with a fresh black ribbon. 
Not a purple or blue ribbon and especially not a used 
ribbon. 

The Teletype type ball must be clean and produce crisp copy. 
Clean the ball with typewriter type cleaner or a stiff 
toothbrush . 

If possible, submit a paper tape of the program. Unoiled 
fan-fold tape is preferable. If you have oiled paper tape 
(as from a Teletype), fan fold it (folds are 8h" apart), 
leave at least 17" blank leader and 8%" trailer tape. 
Rolled paper tape or fan folds much greater or less than 
8h" cannot be handled on our high-speed readers and are 
unusable for making copies. Be. sure to wrap oiled paper 
tape in kitchen plastic wrap or waxed paper when you mail 
it. If you don't the oil seeps out and smears the output. 
Oil seepage has ruined any number of otherwise excellent 
submittals . 



We also have to know: 

A. Your name 

B. Complete address 

C. Telephone 

D. School affiliation 



E. Your age 

F. Computer system used 

G. Original source of program 

(if not you) 



By submitting a program, you are giving Digital Equipment 
Corp. the right to publish, reprint, distribute, or use 
your program in any other way. You will, of course, always 
be cited as the author.
