THIS COMPUTER DEMONSTRATION SIMULATES THE
RESULTS OF FIRING A FIELD ARTILLERY WEAPON.

YOU ARE THE OFFICER-IN-CHARGE, GIVING ORDERS TO THE GUN
CREW, TELLING THEM THE DEGREES OF ELEVATION YOU ESTIMATE
WILL PLACE THE PROJECTILE ON TARGET. A HIT WITHIN 100 YARDS
OF THE TARGET WILL DESTROY IT. TAKE MORE THAN 5 SHOTS,
AND THE ENEMY WILL DESTROY YOU! 

MAXIMUM RANGE OF YOUR GUN IS 46500 YARDS.

DISTANCE TO THE TARGET IS 30489 YARDS


ELEVATION:? 45
OVER TARGET BY 16010 YARDS.

ELEVATION:? 60
OVER TARGET BY 9784 YARDS.

ELEVATION:? 75
SHORT OF TARGET BY 7231 YARDS.

ELEVATION:? 65
OVER TARGET BY 5136 YARDS.

ELEVATION:? 70
SHORT OF TARGET BY 593 YARDS.
