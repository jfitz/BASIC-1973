1 ! BY JEFF DALTON, CLASS OF '74, NORTHFIELD MOUNT HERMON SCHOOL
2 ! THIS PROGRAM PLAYS THE GAME 'HEXAPAWN' BY A METHOD OUTLINED IN 'MATHEMATICAL GAMES' IN MARCH 1962 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.
3 ! THE PROGRAM LEARNS BY ELIMINATION OF BAD MOVES. ALL POSITIONS ENCOUNTERED BY THE PROGRAM AND THE ACCEPTABLE MOVES FROM THEM ARE STORED IN P$(X) 
4 ! WHEN THE PROGRAM ENCOUNTERS AN UNFAMILIAR POSITION, THE POSITION AND ALL LEGAL MOVES FROM IT ARE ADDED TO THE LIST.
5 ! IF THE PROGRAM LOSES A GAME, IT ERASES THE MOVE THAT LED TO DEFEAT. IF IT HITS A POSITION FROM WHICH ALL MOVES HAVE BEEN DELETED (THEY ALL LED TO DEFEAT), IT ERASES THE MOVE THAT GOT IT HERE AND RESIGNS.
