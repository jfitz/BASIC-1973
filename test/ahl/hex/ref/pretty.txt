3     ! THE PROGRAM LEARNS BY ELIMINATION OF BAD MOVES. ALL POSITIONS ENCOUNTERED BY THE PROGRAM AND THE ACCEPTABLE MOVES FROM THEM ARE STORED IN P$(X)

4     ! WHEN THE PROGRAM ENCOUNTERS AN UNFAMILIAR POSITION, THE POSITION AND ALL LEGAL MOVES FROM IT ARE ADDED TO THE LIST.

5     ! IF THE PROGRAM LOSES A GAME, IT ERASES THE MOVE THAT LED TO DEFEAT. IF IT HITS A POSITION FROM WHICH ALL MOVES HAVE BEEN DELETED (THEY ALL LED TO DEFEAT), IT ERASES THE MOVE THAT GOT IT HERE AND RESIGNS.
