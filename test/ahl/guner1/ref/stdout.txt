'ENTER SPEED' TYPE A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100. THIS IS THE 
RELATIVE SPEED OF THE TARGET WHERE 1 IS THE SLOWEST AND 100
IS THE FASTEST.

TO THE QUESTION 'ENTER DISTANCE' ENTER THE MAXIMUM DISTANCE
YOU CAN HIT FROM THE TARGET AND STILL DESTROY IT. THIS IS
THE KILL RADIUS AND 5000 IS SUGGESTED FOR STARTERS.

ELEVATION IS THE ELEVATION OF YOUR GUN IN DEGREES WHEN YOU
FIRE AT THE TARGET. THE MAXIMUN RANGE IS AT 45 DEGREES
