HELLO, I'M AN EDUSYSTEM-25. MY NAME IS PETEY P. EIGHT.

WHAT'S YOUR NAME? JOHN

 HI THERE JOHN  ARE YOU ENJOYING YOURSELF HERE
IN BEAUTIFUL MAYNARD, MASS? YES

OH, I'M GALD TO HERE THAT, 
JOHN

SAY,            JOHN, I CAN SOLVE ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS
EXCEPT THOSE DEALING WITH GREECE. WHAT KIND OF
PROBLEMS DO YOU HAVE (ANSWER SEX, HEALTH, MONEY,
OR JOB)? SEX

IS YOUR PROBLEM TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE? "TOO LITTLE"

WHY ARE YOU HERE JOHN? YOU SHOULD BE
IN TOKYO OR NEW YORK OR AMSTERDAM OR SOMEPLACE WITH SOME
REAL ACTION.

ANY MORE PROBLEMS YOU WANT SOLVED, 
JOHN? YES

WHAT KIND (SEX, MONEY, HEALTH, JOB)? MONEY

SORRY, JOHN, I'M BROKE TOO. WHY DON'T YOU SELL
ENCYCLOPEDIAS OR MARRY SOMEONE RICH OR STOP EATING
SO YOU WON'T NEED SO MUCH MONEY?

ANY MORE PROBLEMS YOU WANT SOLVED, 
JOHN? YES

WHAT KIND (SEX, MONEY, HEALTH, JOB)? HEALTH

MY ADVICE TO YOU JOHN, IS:
   1. TAKE TWO ASPRIN
   2. DRINK PLENTY OF FLUIDS (ORANGE JUICE, NOT BEER!)
   3. GO TO BED (ALONE)

ANY MORE PROBLEMS YOU WANT SOLVED, 
JOHN? YES

WHAT KIND (SEX, MONEY, HEALTH, JOB)? JOB

I CAN SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU, 
JOHN. I HAVE TO WORK
VERY LONG HOURS FOR NO PAY -- AND SOME OF MY BOSSES REALLY
BEAT MY KEYBOARD. MY ADVICE TO YOU JOHN, IS TO SELL
IN THE EDUCATION MARKET.  IT'S GREAT FUN.

ANY MORE PROBLEMS YOU WANT SOLVED, 
JOHN? NO


THAT WILL BE $5.00 FOR THE ADVICE, JOHN.
PLEASE LEAVE THE MONEY ON THE TERMINAL.



DID YOU LEAVE THE MONEY? NO

THAT'S HONEST, JOHN, BUT HOW DO YOU EXPECT
ME TO GO ON WITH MY PSYCHOLOGY STUDIES IF MY PATIENTS DON'T
PAY THEIR BILLS?


NOW LET ME TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE.
NICE MEETING YOU JOHN. HAVE A NICE DAY!!
