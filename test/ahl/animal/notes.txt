Why does BASIC-1973 not run this program?

BASIC-1973 does not have the DEF/FNEND construct, or the multi-statement user-defined function.

DEF/FNEND raises a number of issues.
One is in parsing: how to handle a function name on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Another is in the assignment values to arguments.
Specifically, if a multi-statement user-defined function is called with A as parameter X, what is the behavior if the function contains an assignment to X?
Or an assignment to A?

Should an assignment to A flow through to X?
Should the assignment to X remain local to the function?
Or should it flow back to A?

What is the behavior if a user-defined function invokes another user-defined function, and we have the same questions but with two levels of functions?
