THIS IS A GAME OF GUESSING,
FOR INSTRUCTIONS, TYPE '1', ELSE TYPE '0'? 1

PLEASE TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER AND WRITE DOWN
THE DIGITS '0', '1', OR '2' THIRTY TIMES AT RANDOM,
ARRANGE THEM IN THREE LINES OF TEN DIGITS.
I WILL ASK FOR THEM 10 AT A TIME.
I WILL ALWAYS GUESS FIRST, AND THEN LOOK AT YOUR
NEXT NUMBER TO SEE IF I WAS RIGHT. BY PURE LUCK I
OUGHT TO 8E RIGHT 10 TIMES, BUT I HOPE TO DO BETTER
THAN THAT ****
