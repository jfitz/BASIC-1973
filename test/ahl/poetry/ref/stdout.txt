 RANDOM POETRY IN FOUR PART HARMONY,



 THE HOURS DESENDED
                   PUTTING ON STARS
FOR IF HE IS GONE AND I AM HERE
    THERE IS NO MEETING

A CANDLE IS LIGHTED
    AND IT IS DARK
ON EARTH A CANDLE IS EXTINGUISHED
    THE CITY WAKES
AND IT IS DAWN
              THE WORLD
    GOES FORTH TO MURDER DREAMS
THE PEOPLE ARE IN THEIR HOUSES

HIS MOST WISE MUSIC STOLE
    NOTHING FROM DEATH
OR WITH THY MIND AGAINST MY MIND,
    YOU SHOULD NOT HEAR ME SPEAK
AND TWICE REPEATED THERE
    WAS NO MORE
THE HOURS RISE UP PUTTING OFF STARS
    AND IT IS DAWN
LOVE IS THE EVER ONLY GOD
ON EARTH A CANDLE IS EXTINGUISHED
    THE CITY WAKES
AND SPACE IS MISSING FOR IT WAS 
STOLEN FOR ALL TIME TO COME 

IN THE MIRROR I SEE A MAN, AND HE
    SCREAMS
FOR HE IS ME
            AND I HE
