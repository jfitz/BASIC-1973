THIS IS A NUMBER GUESSING GAME.  I'LL THINK
OF A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND ANY LIMIT YOU WANT.
THEN YOU HAVE TO GUESS WHAT IT IS.

WHAT LIMIT DO YOU WANT? 100

I'M THINKING OF A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100
NOW YOU TRY TO GUESS WHAT IT IS
? 50
TOO HIGH. GUESS AGAIN.
? 25
TOO LOW. GUESS AGAIN.
? 37
TOO LOW. GUESS AGAIN.
? 42
