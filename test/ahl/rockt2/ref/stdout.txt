LUNAR LANDING SIMULATION

HAVE YOU FLOWN ON AN APOLLO/LEM MISSION BEFORE#(YES OR NO)? NO

WHICH SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT DO YOU PREFER?
 1= METRIC    0=ENGLISH
ENTER THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER? 0


 YOU ARE ON A LUNAR LANDING MISSION. AS THE PILOT OF
THE LUNAR EXCURSION MODULE, YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO
GIVE CERTAIN COMMANDS TO THE MODULE NAVIGATION SYSTEM.
 THE ON BOARD COMPUTER WILL GIVE A RUNNING ACCOUNT
OF INFORMATION NEEDED TO NAVIGATE THE SHIP.


THE ATTITUDE ANGLE CALLED FOR IS DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS-
+ OR -180 DEGREES IS DIRECTLY AWAY FROM THE MOON
-90 DEGREES IS ON A TANGENT IN THE DIRECTION OF ORBIT
90 DEGREES IS CN A TANGENT FROM THE DIRECTION OF ORBIT
0 (ZERO) DEGREES IS DIRECTLY TOWARD THE MOON

                              -180,180
                                  ^
                           -90 < -+- > 90
                                  !
                                  0
                       << DIRECTION OF ORBIT <<

                           SURFACE OF MOON


ALL ANGLES BETWEEN -180 AND 180 ARE ACCEPTED.

1 FUEL UNIT = 1 SEC. AT MAX. THRUST
ANY DISCREPANCIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE USE OF FUEL
FOR AN ATTITUDE CHANGE.
AVAILABLE ENGINE POWER: (ZERO) AND ANY VALUE BETWEEN
10 AND 100 PERCENT

NEGATIVE THRUST OR TIME IS PROHIBITED


INPUT: TIME INTERVAL IN SECONDS ------ (T)
       PERCENTAGE OF THRUST ---------- (P)
       ATTITUDE ANGLE IN DEGREES ----- (A)

FOR EXAMPLE:
T,P,A? 10,65,-60
TO ABORT THE MISSION AT ANY TIME, ENTER 0,0,0

OUTPUT: TOTAL TIME ELAPSED IN SECONDS
        HEIGHT IN FEET
        DISTANCE FROM LANDING SITE INFEET
        VERTICAL VELOCITY IN FEET/SECOND
        HORIZONTAL VELOCITY IN FEET/SECOND

CRASH !!!!!!!!!!
YOUR IMPACT CREATED A CRATER 6775.95 FEET DEEP
AT CONTACT YOU WERE TRAVELLING 2952.79  N.MILES/HR.

DO YOU WANT TO FLY IT AGAIN ? (YES OR NO)? NO

TOO BAD, THE SPACE PROGRAM HATES TO LOSE EXPERIENCED ASTRONAUTS.
