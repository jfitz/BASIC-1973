I AM THINKING OF A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100
TRY TO GUESS MY NUMBER. ON EACH GUESS,
YOU ARE TO ENTER 2 NUMBERS, TRYING TO TRAP
MY NUMBER BETWEEN THE TWO NUMBERS. I WILL
TELL YOU IF YOU HAVE TRAPPED MY NUMBER, IF MY
NUMBER IS LARGER THAN YOUR TWO NUMBERS, OR IF
MY NUMBER IS SMALLER THAN YOUR TWO NUMBERS.
IF YOU WANT TO GUESS ONE SINGLE NUMBER, TYPE
YOUR GUESS FOR BOTH YOUR TRAP NUMBERS.
YOU GET 6 GUESSES TO GET MY NUMBER.

GUESS # 1 ? 37,67
YOU HAVE TRAPPED MY NUMBER.

GUESS # 2 ? 45,55
MY NUMBER IS SMALLER THEN YOUR TRAP NUMBERS.

GUESS # 3 ? 30,40
MY NUMBER IS LARGER THAN YOUR TRAP NUMBERS.

GUESS # 4 ? 41,43
YOU HAVE TRAPPED MY NUMBER.

GUESS # 5 ? 42,42
