YOU ARE THE WEAPONS OFFICER ON THE STAR SHIP ENTERPRISE
AND THIS IS A TEST TO SEE HOW ACCURATE A SHOT YOU
ARE IN A THREE- DIMENSIONAL RANGE, YOU WILL BE TOLD
THE RADIAN OFTSET OF THE X AND Z AXES, THE LOCATION
OF THE TARGET IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL RECTANGULAR COORDINATES,
THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF DEGREES FROM THE X AND Z
AXES, AND THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE TO THE TARGET.
YOU WILL THEN PROCEED TO SHOOT AT THE TARGET UNTIL IT IS
DESTROYED!

GOOD LUCK!!
